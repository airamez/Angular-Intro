# Architecture Overview
https://angular.io/guide/architecture
- The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation context for components.
- NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
- An app always has at least a root module (AppModule) that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.
- Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data.
- Components use services, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be injected into components as dependencies, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.
